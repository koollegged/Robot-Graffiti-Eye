Robot-Graffiti-Eye
==================

Generative art program

--------

This project is called Robot Graffiti Eye.
https://github.com/koollegged/Robot-Graffiti-Eye

It is inspired by street art.  One element of street art is the interaction with the environment.  It is as much about what you create as where you create it. And visually, there is usually some 3d perspective implied.

I tried to capture both ideas in this project.  It is about interaction with the computer…
The computer captures whatever is in front of it and interprets it..the lights and darks, shapes and colors.  All this appears on the screen in front of the viewer?(user?) so they can alter it, in real time.

The viewer/user also has control of the shapes, size, and orientation through the controller  - http://createcreate.us/exquisite-corpse/source/wall-control.php.

It is also about how the computer interacts with us.  It sees us and authors it’s vision.

There is another layer of interaction as well.  Anyone with a computer (albeit a powerful one) can run this program, make a movie, and output prints like these.  However, there is only one controller...that anyone with an internet connection can access.

These prints can’t represent all I have described, but it shows the computer’s output.  I think it’s a beautiful rendering of the world.
